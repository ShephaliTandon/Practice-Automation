Practice Automation
==

Automated various end-to-end scenarios using all the Selenium concepts, including different user interactions using mouse and keyboard within the website and on the browser, pop-ups, file upload and download, etc.

#Setup

Download the latest version of Selenium web driver from [here](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). 

By default, this repository contains the `chromedriver.exe`, which is the web driver for Google Chrome on Windows computers. 

This is an eclipse project. You can directly open this project on Eclipse and use the "run" button on any of the `.java` files in the `src/PracticeAutomation` folder to run the corresponding Selenium script.
